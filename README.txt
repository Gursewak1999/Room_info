Hope you would recognise the efforts and truely Appriciate it.

To run this you should have any version of DOS  operating system or an DOS emmulator for your PC. 

To open just navigate to the location of the app and execute it by just typing its name.

This program uses a set of Data files with .csv extension containing the  schedule of that day.
Name of the file is just the first three characters of the day of the week with .csv extension.

The .csv extension makes the program more user-friendly. User may just open the file with Microsoft excel or any spreadsheet software and edit the recommended details .

Hope you may be rightly satisfied with the stuff.
